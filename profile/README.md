🌈 We mainly apply machine learning techniques to computer vision problems. Our research interests include visual quality assessment and enhancement, intelligent visual arts generation, biomedical image analysis, etc. 

🧙 We have developed a series of demonstrations for artistic portrait drawing generation (APDG), including an applet, a robot, and a printer. Our demonstrations are easy to use and have achieved excellent user experience in various exhibitions. You can try our demos by scanning the following QR code （"妙绘艺术"微信小程序）.
